| 02 | [Broken Object Level Authorization](02-bola-authorization.md) | 8.5 | High | CWE-639 |
| 03 | [Insecure File Upload](03-insecure-file-upload.md) | 9.8 | Critical | CWE-434 |
| 04 | [Insecure Payment Gateway](04-payment-gateway.md) | 9.4 | Critical | CWE-311 |
| 05 | [Information Disclosure](05-information-disclosure.md) | 6.5 | Medium | CWE-200 |
| 06 | [Multi-Tenant Isolation Bypass](06-tenant-isolation.md) | 8.1 | High | CWE-284 |

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Vulnerabilities (3)
- **Insecure File Upload (9.8):** Remote code execution capability
- **Insecure Payment Gateway (9.4):** Financial data exposure
- **Plaintext Password Storage (9.1):** Complete credential compromise

### High Vulnerabilities (2)
- **Broken Object Level Authorization (8.5):** Cross-user data access
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation Bypass (8.1):** Cross-tenant data breach

### Medium Vulnerabilities (1)
- **Information Disclosure (6.5):** System reconnaissance and token exposure

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing
Run all exploit scripts to verify vulnerabilities:
```bash
cd exploit-scripts
python3 run_all_exploits.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Authentication Testing:** Verify plaintext password storage in database
2. **Authorization Testing:** Test cross-user and cross-tenant access
3. **File Upload Testing:** Upload malicious files and attempt execution
4. **Payment Testing:** Submit payment data and verify plaintext storage
5. **Information Gathering:** Access system endpoints and error messages

### Verification Steps
Each vulnerability can be verified through:
1. **Code Review:** Examine source code for security flaws
2. **Dynamic Testing:** Execute provided exploit scripts
3. **Database Inspection:** Direct database queries to confirm data exposure
4. **Network Analysis:** Monitor API requests and responses

## Exploitation Framework

### Prerequisites
- TenantGuard application running locally
- Python 3.6+ with requests library
- MongoDB access for database verification
- Network access to application endpoints

### Exploit Execution
```bash
# Individual vulnerability testing
python3 exploit-scripts/plaintext_passwords.py
python3 exploit-scripts/bola_exploit.py
python3 exploit-scripts/file_upload_exploit.py
python3 exploit-scripts/payment_gateway_exploit.py
python3 exploit-scripts/information_disclosure_exploit.py
python3 exploit-scripts/tenant_isolation_exploit.py

# Comprehensive testing
python3 exploit-scripts/run_all_exploits.py
```

## Remediation Priority

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **File Upload Security:** Implement file type validation and remove execution endpoint
2. **Payment Security:** Integrate secure payment processor and encrypt sensitive data
3. **Password Security:** Implement bcrypt hashing for all passwords

### High Priority
1. **Authorization Controls:** Add proper ownership and tenant verification
2. **Tenant Isolation:** Enforce strict tenant boundaries in all queries

### Medium Priority
1. **Information Security:** Remove sensitive data from error messages and system endpoints

## Educational Use

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding common web application vulnerabilities
- Recognizing insecure coding patterns
- Learning secure development practices
- Practicing penetration testing techniques

### Training Scenarios
- **Red Team Exercises:** Use exploits to demonstrate attack vectors
- **Blue Team Training:** Practice vulnerability detection and response
- **Secure Code Review:** Identify and fix security flaws
- **Compliance Testing:** Verify security control effectiveness

## Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Authorized Use Only
- Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Do not deploy in production environments
- Respect all applicable laws and regulations
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Educational Context
- Designed for security research and training purposes
- All vulnerabilities are intentionally implemented
- Not suitable for production deployment
- Use for authorized penetration testing only

## Documentation Standards

Each vulnerability document includes:
- **Technical Analysis:** Root cause and implementation details
- **Proof of Concept:** Step-by-step exploitation process
- **Working Exploit:** Functional Python script for testing
- **Impact Assessment:** Business and technical consequences
- **Remediation Guide:** Secure implementation recommendations

## Support and Updates
