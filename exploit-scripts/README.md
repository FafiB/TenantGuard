# TenantGuard Security Testing Scripts

**Author:** Fasika Belayneh  
**Purpose:** Security vulnerability testing and penetration testing

## Overview

This directory contains Python scripts designed to test various security vulnerabilities in the TenantGuard application. These scripts are for educational and authorized security testing purposes only.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- requests library: `pip install requests`
- TenantGuard application running on localhost:5000

## Exploit Scripts

### 1. plaintext_passwords.py
Tests for plaintext password storage vulnerability
- Registers user with weak 3-character password
- Verifies passwords are stored without hashing

### 2. bola_exploit.py  
Tests Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
- Cross-tenant document access
- Direct document access without ownership verification

### 3. file_upload_exploit.py
Tests insecure file upload vulnerabilities
- Uploads executable files (.bat, .exe)
- Attempts file execution on server

### 4. payment_exploit.py
Tests payment gateway security issues
- Processes payments with fake card data
- Accesses other users' payment history

### 5. directory_traversal.py
Tests directory traversal vulnerabilities  
- Accesses system files without authentication
- Enumerates uploaded files

### 6. admin_escalation.py
Tests admin privilege escalation
- Cross-tenant data access as admin
- System-wide user and document access

### 7. info_disclosure.py
Tests information disclosure vulnerabilities
- Password reset token exposure
- System information leakage

### 8. tenant_bypass.py
Tests tenant isolation bypass
- Bypasses multi-tenant restrictions
- Cross-tenant data access

## Usage

### Run Individual Scripts
```bash
python3 plaintext_passwords.py
python3 bola_exploit.py
# ... etc
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
python3 run_all_exploits.py
```

## Expected Results

If vulnerabilities exist, scripts will output:
- `[+] SUCCESS` messages for successful exploits
- Detailed information about exposed data
- System information disclosure

## Legal Notice

These scripts are for authorized security testing only. Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use may violate laws and regulations.

## Mitigation

After testing, implement proper security measures:
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Validate file uploads
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Fix information disclosure issues
